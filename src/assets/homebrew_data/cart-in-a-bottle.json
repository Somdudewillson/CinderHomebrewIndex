It measures 3 inches long and 1 inch wide, and It weighs a surprising 15 pounds. This item also has two command words, requiring you to use an action to speak it.","The first command word, when spoken to the bottle, causes the cart within the bottle to appear within 20 feet of the attuned creature. The cart has an exquisite and opulent appearance, it has a patterned canvas cover, an ever-burning lantern on the front, and a permanent elusion of covered crates in the back (or whatever the DM decides), The cart does not appear with horses. The cart, regardless of what\u0027s on or in it, weighs 500 pounds. The exterior of the cart is 10 by 15 feet not including the shafts. the interior of the cart is much larger than the exterior, being 20 by 30 feet.","The second command word, when spoken to the bottle, causes the cart to return to the bottle regardless of distance. When it returns it will return with any non-living things but any living creatures within are left where they are.","Any damage sustained while out of the bottle will not be repaired on its return but can be repaired manually. The cart, without horses, has a speed of 20ft, and with horses, it works like any other cart. only the attuned creature can drive the cart.","Notes: creature with Vehicle Proficiency (land) and said creature must focus on it for 3 hours, Movement, Utility, Exploration"]}
