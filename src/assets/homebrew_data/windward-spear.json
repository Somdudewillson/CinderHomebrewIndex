While attuned to this spear, pearly white clouds swirl around it and you gain the following benefits:","You gain a +2 bonus to attacks and damage rolls made with this weapon. ","While it is raining, you gain a flying speed of 30 feet. If you already have a flying speed of 15 feet or greater, it increases by 15 feet. If it stops raining, you safely descend at a rate of 30 feet per round if you otherwise lack a flying speed.","As a bonus action, you may speak the spearâ€™s command word and cause the clouds to turn dark. For one minute, this spear deals an additional 1d4 lightning damage and you may take two reactions each round, instead of one. The second reaction you take each round must be an opportunity attack. ","The spear has 6 charges. You may spend 4 charges to cast the Lightning Bolt spell at 3rd Level, with a Save DC of 15. When you hit a creature with an attack, you may spend 3 charges to force the creature to make a DC 15 CON save or become stunned until the end of your next turn. Alternatively, you may spend 1 charge to deal an additional 2d4 lightning damage to the creature. ","Proficiency with a spear allows you to add your proficiency bonus to the attack roll for any attack you make with it."]}
