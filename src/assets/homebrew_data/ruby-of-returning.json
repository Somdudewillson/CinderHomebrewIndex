If the weapon leaves your hand, the weapon reappears in your hand at the end of the current turn. For this property to work, you must attach the ruby to the weapon by pressing the ruby against it for at least 10 minutes. Thereafter, the ruby can\u0027t be removed unless you detach it as an action or the weapon is destroyed. Not even an Antimagic Field causes it to fall off. The ruby does fall off the weapon if your attunement to the ruby ends."]}
