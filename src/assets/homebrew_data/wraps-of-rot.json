","This item has 3 charges, and it regains 1d3 Charges daily at dawn. ","Whirlwind of Sand. At the cost of one charge you can spend an action to magically transform into a whirlwind of sand, move up to 60 feet, and revert back to normal form. While in the whirlwind form the user gains resistance to all damage, and it can\u0027t be grappled, petrified, knocked prone, restrained, or stunned. ","Curse. While attuned to this item nothing happens, once attunement with the wraps are broken the user is Cursed with mummy rot. The Cursed target can\u0027t regain Hit Points, and its hit point maximum decreases by 10, 3d6, for every 24 hours that elapse. If the curse reduces the target\u0027s hit point maximum to 0, the target dies, and its body turns to dust. The curse lasts until removed by the Remove Curse spell or other magic.","Notes: Cursed"]}
